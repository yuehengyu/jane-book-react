A cheap Huawei Mate 20 Pro? Yes please</b>：Currently Fonehouse has the Huawei Mate 20 Pro – a brand new £899 smartphone – going for the incredibly low price of, well, £49. That’s right, with this 100GB Vodafone contract, you don’t have to pay less than £50 upfront outside of the £36 monthly rate；</p> <p>The total cost of ownership from this contract comes in at just £913. No, that’s not a typo and yes, that is in fact only marginally pricier than buying the phone SIM free which is currently £899；</p><p>If for some reason you’re still on the fence, allow me to explain why the Mate 20 Pro is one of the best smartphones in recent memory. Of all of its many features, the easiest to spot is its gorgeous 6.39-inch OLED display, which is an absolute treat on the eyes particularly when watching HDR compatible content</p><p>For all the time you’ll spend taking pictures of pets and food, the Mate 20 Pro’s massive 4200mAh battery will keep you going all day without the need for a top-up.。</p>"
